  <p>Of late, I’ve been trying to get to the base of how algorithms and mathematics works in general. I’ve wanted to do this for a while because I have an inane fear of Mathematics, and I wanted to face it.</p>
<p>This was also an effort to deep dive into the fundamentals of Computer Science, a topic dear to my heart, but something I’ve ignored for a while. I chanced upon <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">Teach Yourself CS</a>, a good roadmap for getting started with brushing up your CS fundamentals.</p>
<p>As a part of this roadmap, I’ve been solving programs on Project Euler, Hacker Rank and other competitive coding websites. And almost all programs will have a challenge that includes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci Sequence</a>.</p>
<p>For ex : Here is Project Euler’s 2nd Program</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,</p>
<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and here’s how I solved it</p>
<pre><code>    i = 0
    j = 1
    sum = 0
    num = 0
    while (num &lt; 4000000):    
         num = i + j    
         i = j    
         j = num    
         if num % 2 == 0:        
         sum = sum + num    
    print(&quot;Final Sum is&quot;)
    print(sum)
</code></pre>
<p>If you can overlook my use of the while loop and my amateur Python skills, this looks like a good start. However while working on this program, I went on a rabbit hole, trying to read more about Fibonacci Sequence.</p>
<p>That’s when I stumbled upon the different applications for the sequence. One fun use case is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker">Planning Poker</a>, where participants in a Scrum meeting are given the sequence cards for estimation. But what enchanted me was the fact that the sequence appears in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Nature">biological settings</a> as well. For ex: Some flowers are pentagonal because of the arrangement of spirals.</p>
<p>And it also extends into genealogy as well. Bees for that matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>If an egg is laid by an unmated female, it hatches a male or drone bee.</li>
<li>If, however, an egg was fertilized by a male, it hatches a female.</li>
</ul>
<p>And thus, if one were to trace the ancestory of any male bee, he has 1 parent bee, 2 grandparents, 3 great grand parents and so on.</p>
<p>While learning all these facts about how mathematics and nature are interlocked, I chanced upon a Rene Descartes quote</p>
<p><strong>In my opinion, everything happens in nature in a mathematical way.</strong></p>
<p>Indeed.</p>

  <p>In one of the recent projects that I have been working on, I had to look for a word in a phrase - but the challenge was to rank an occurrence of the phrase higher when it’s an individual word as compared to when it was part of a word.</p>
<p>For ex : Food Blogger should rate higher than Ardent Foodie, because in the first example - Food is an individual word as compared to latter where it is part of a whole word.</p>
<p>At times like this, I find MySQL’s <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/regexp.html">REGEXP</a> quite useful, as I can use different regular expressions to fit my criteria. So here’s what I did here</p>
<p>I first looked for an individual occurrence of a word.</p>
<p><code>select * from table_name where search_term REGEXP '[[:&lt;:]]food[[:&gt;:]]';</code></p>
<p>Here, [[:&lt;:]] &amp; [[:&gt;:]] are markers that stand for word boundaries. They match the beginning and end of words, respectively. Now, as a next step, I follow it by this query.</p>
<p><code>select * from table_name where search_term LIKE '%food%';</code></p>
<p>But when the first case happens, it gets an higher priority as compared to the second case - so I reworked the query to this</p>
<pre><code>select table_name.title, (case when search_term REGEXP '[[:&lt;:]]food[[:&gt;:]]'  
then 100 when search_term LIKE '%food%' then 99 else 1 end) as priority  
from table_name order by `priority` desc;  
</code></pre>
<p>That way, results that have the word as a standalone rank higher up as compared to when they are part of a phrase.</p>
